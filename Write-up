Title: Comparative Analysis of Linear and Polynomial Regression Models

Problem Statement:
To apply and test Linear and Polynomial Regression models on a specified dataset illustrating the relationship between hours of driving and risk score for acute backache. Also, choose a high-dimensional dataset (e.g., Diabetes dataset) from a data library such as SK-Learn, UCI library, or Kaggle dataset library to apply Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models.Test and compare the models.

Hardware Requirements:
Processor: Intel Core i3 or higher
RAM: 4GB or higher
Hard Disk: 10GB free space
Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS

Software Requirements:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Theory:
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the dependent variable in terms of one or more independent variables.

Linear Regression:
Linear Regression is a supervised learning method which approximates the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables in the form of a linear equation.

Polynomial Regression:
Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression wherein dependence relationship among dependent and independent variable is explained by using an nth degree polynomial.

Ridge Regression:
It is linear regression with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
It imposes a penalty term on the square of the absolute size of the coefficient.

Lasso Regression:
It is linear regression with L1 regularization which does involve feature selection by dropping certain coefficients via zeroing.

ElasticNet Regression:
The ElasticNet regression is an amalgamation of L2 and L1 regularization regression model.

Conclusion:
Linear and Polynomial Regression are powerful in modeling relations between variables. Polynomial Regression is more flexible in modeling non-linear trends in the data. Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models are required in the case of high-dimensional data in order to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. The performance of every model varies with the nature of the dataset as well as the form of the relationship.
